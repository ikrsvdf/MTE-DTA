Abstract：Parasites, including protozoa and helminths, are diverse and widely transmitted, causing numerous diseases and being major contributors to outbreaks in many regions worldwide. 
Although various antiparasitic drugs are currently in use, their efficacy is often limited by high costs, toxicity, significant side effects, and drug resistance. 
Therefore, developing novel, safe, and effective antiparasitic treatments has become an urgent and important challenge. 
Antiparasitic drugs typically function by interfering with key proteins within parasites; therefore, identifying potential drug targets and predicting their binding affinity to candidate compounds are crucial steps in antiparasitic drug discovery.
To overcome the limitations of existing drug–target affinity (DTA) prediction models in modality alignment and feature fusion, we propose MTE-DTA, a Transformer-based multi-scale framework for drug–target affinity prediction. The model innovatively integrates an imbalanced Transformer encoder with a bilinear attention mechanism to capture fine-grained interactions between drug substructures and protein residues across multiple scales, thereby achieving more accurate and robust affinity estimation. Experimental results on our newly curated parasite-related drug–target affinity dataset as well as on several public benchmark datasets demonstrate that MTE-DTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the model exhibits strong generalization ability across various real-world scenarios.
